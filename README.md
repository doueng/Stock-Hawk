# Stock Hawk

This app lets you see the current stock prices of companies and the prices over time in a graph.

This was the second project I completed in the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree. The project involved productionizing an 
existing app by finding and handeling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget 
and adding a library.
